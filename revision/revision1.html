            <h1>The Legend of the Jaisalmer Fort</h1>
            <p>
                In the heart of the Thar Desert lies the majestic Jaisalmer Fort, often called the "Golden Fort" due to
                its
                yellow sandstone walls that glow in the sunlight.
                According to legend, it was built in 1156 AD by Rawal Jaisal, a Rajput ruler who dreamed of creating an
                invincible city on the hill.
                The fort has seen centuries of battles, heroism, and mystery. One popular tale tells of the brave Rajput
                women
                who committed Jauhar (self-immolation)
                to protect their honor when the fort was under siege. Even today, locals believe that the spirits of
                those times
                still roam the fort’s alleys,
                whispering tales of courage and sacrifice. Tourists from across the world visit to experience its
                architecture,
                culture, and the haunting echoes of its past.
