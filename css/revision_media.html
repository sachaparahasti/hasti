            <header>The Last Light 1</header>
            <p>
                In a distant world consumed by eternal night, a small village clung to the memory of sunlight.
                Every home guarded a single ember—passed down through generations, believed to be the last spark of the
                sun.
                When the embers began to die, a blind girl named Lira claimed she could see a new light beyond the dark
                mountains. Mocked but undeterred, she set off alone, guided by faith and the warmth in her heart.
            </p>
            <p>
                Days later, as despair swallowed the village, a golden glow crept over the horizon. Lira
                returned, leading a dawn never seen before. Light had returned—carried by belief.

            <header>Doraemon and the Time Seed 2</header>
            <p>One day, Nobita found an old seed in Doraemon's gadget drawer labeled “Time Seed.” Curious, he
                planted it in the backyard. Instantly, a tree shot up, growing fruits that showed glimpses of the future
                when touched. Nobita saw himself as a successful scientist, but also saw a lonely life without his
                friends.</p>
            <p>Worried, he rushed to Doraemon, who explained that the future can always change. Inspired,
                Nobita shared the fruits with his friends and promised to stay close to them. With Doraemon's help, he
                began
                working harder—not just for success, but for happiness with the people he cared about.</p>

            <header>The Invisible Painter 3</header>
            <p>In a quiet town, a boy named Arin painted with invisible colors—no one could see his art, but
                he believed it was beautiful. While others laughed, he filled walls, trees, and skies with colors only
                he
                could feel. Every stroke carried his dreams, his hopes, and the magic he saw in the world.</p>
            <p>One day, a stranger passed through town and gasped at Arin's wall. “Who painted this?” she
                cried, seeing what others couldn't. Slowly, more people began to see the colors too. Arin's belief had
                made
                the invisible visible. His idea changed the way the world saw beauty.</p>

            <header>The Seed of an Idea 4</header>
            <p>In a small village, a boy named Kavi watched birds build a nest using twigs and threads.
                Inspired, he thought, “If birds can build homes without hands, why can't I create something useful too?”
                He
                began collecting broken tools, wires, and wood, dreaming of building a machine to help farmers in his
                village.</p>
            <p>Everyone laughed at his strange idea, but Kavi kept working. Months later, he unveiled a
                simple machine that made planting seeds faster and easier. His idea, once ignored, changed many lives.
                From
                one small thought, a big difference grew—proving that great things often start with one simple idea.</p>

            <header>The Brave Little Sparrow 5</header>
            <p>In a quiet forest, a little sparrow named Pip dreamed of flying beyond the tallest trees. While
                other birds were happy staying close to home, Pip wanted to see the world. One morning, he gathered
                courage
                and soared higher than ever before, facing strong winds and dark clouds along the way.</p>
            <p>After days of travel, Pip found a valley filled with fruits, fresh water, and warm sunshine. He
                flew back to his forest and led the other birds to the new land. Pip s bravery gave his flock a better
                life—proving that even the smallest bird can make a big difference.</p>
